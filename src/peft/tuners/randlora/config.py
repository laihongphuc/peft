class RandLoraConfig(PeftConfig):
    """
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`RandLoraModel`].

    Paper: {}.

    Args:
        r (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `32`):
            RandLora's random basis rank dimension. This parameter is inversely proportional to the amount of trainable parameters.
        target_modules (`Union[List[str], str]`):
            The names of the modules to apply RandLora to. Only linear layers are supported.
        projection_prng_key (`int`):
            RandLora PRNG init key. Used for initialising basis_A and basis_B for new models or when loading a checkpoint
            that did not include these projections. Defaults to `int(math.exp(1)*3.1415*1000)`.
        save_projection (`bool`):
            Whether to save the global basis_A / basis_B random basis in the state dict alongside per layer lambda / gamma diagonal matrices.
            weights. This will increase the size of the checkpoint, but guarantee that we can reload the checkpoint on
            all system configurations. Defaults to `True`.
        sparse (`bool`):
            Whether to use sparse random bases as described in the RandLora paper. The current implementation is a proof of concept where the sparseness is not used to improve speed or memory usage. Defaults to `False`.
        very_sparse (`bool`):
            Whether to use very sparse random bases. The current implementation is a proof of concept where the sparseness is not used to improve speed or memory usage. Defaults to `False`.
        randlora_dropout (`float`):
            The dropout probability for RandLora layers.
        randlora_alpha (`float`):
            The scaling coefficient for RandLora layers, this would be typically be the same as LoRA, e.g. 2 times the rank.
        fan_in_fan_out (`bool`):
            Set this to True if the layer to replace stores weight like (fan_in, fan_out). For example, gpt-2 uses
            `Conv1D` which stores weights like (fan_in, fan_out) and hence this should be set to `True`.
        bias (`str`):
            Bias type. Can be 'none', 'all' or 'randlora_only'. If 'all' or 'randlora_only', the corresponding biases
            will be updated during training. Be aware that this means that, even when disabling the adapters, the model
            will not produce the same output as the base model would have without adaptation.
        modules_to_save (`List[str]`):
            List of modules apart from RandLora layers to be set as trainable and saved in the final checkpoint.
        init_weights (`bool`):
            Whether to initialize the weights of the RandLora layers with their default initialization. Don't change this
            setting, except if you know exactly what you're doing.
        layers_to_transform (`Union[List[int],int]`):
            The layer indexes to transform, if this argument is specified, it will apply the RandLora transformations on
            the layer indexes that are specified in this list. If a single integer is passed, it will apply the RandLora
            transformations on the layer at this index.
        layers_pattern (`str`):
            The layer pattern name, used only if `layers_to_transform` is different from `None` and if the layer
            pattern is not in the common layers pattern.
